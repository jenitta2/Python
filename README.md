# Python

Python is an interpreted and dynamic typed language which is prefered among new developers for its simplicity.

I took a challenge of learning python within 90 days as my major programming language.

I will keep on updating this repository daily with my daily learning portions.

Thanks for visiting my repository.

Let's keep learning together❤️
